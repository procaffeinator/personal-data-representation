                <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
                <p>I began by consolidating data from the last two months, specifically Jan-Feb 2024, to understand how
                    my
                    sleep hours and screen time vary according to the phase of my menstrual cycle. Through this
                    exploration,
                    I aimed to find correlations between these variables and gain insights into my digital habits and
                    overall well-being.</p>

                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>For my data collection process, I utilized various sources to gather information on:</p>
                <p><strong>{Date, Day, Screen Time, Phase of Menstrual Cycle, Phase of Detox Cycle, Top 3 Apps}</strong>
                </p>

                <p>To track <strong>Screen Time</strong>, I relied on iPhone settings, which provided daily insights
                    into my screen
                    usage. Extracting details on the <strong>Top 3 Apps</strong> was straightforward from
                    iPhone settings,
                    identifying my most frequently used applications. For monitoring <strong>menstrual cycle
                        phases</strong>, I used
                    a menstrual tracker app (PC) to log and classify different stages. The experiment consisted of
                    two distinct phases: the initial 10 days were <strong>non-detox</strong>, while the subsequent 10
                    days were
                    <strong>detox</strong>. I compiled all of this data in Google Sheets.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a summary of the compiled dataset for reference:</p>

                <h3>Data Feminism</h3>
                <p>As I delved deeper into my data analysis, I recognized the importance of tracing back to the context
                    surrounding the data. Incorporating menstrual cycle data into my analysis fostered a more inclusive
                    understanding of menstrual health and its impact on my digital usage. This approach, rooted in data
                    feminism [3], helped me comprehend and visualize the intricate relationship between my menstrual
                    cycle
                    and
                    digital habits.</p>

                <h3>Design Transition (Design Iterations)</h3>
                <p> I noticed through my initial data analysis that I spend a lot of time mindlessly scrolling through
                    Instagram.
                    I decided to do a detox experiment to compare screen time across a 20-day window,
                    divided
                    into 10 days of non-detox and 10 days of detox, where I uninstalled Instagram. This detox
                    aimed to regulate my digital usage and monitor my digital footprint more effectively. During this
                    period, I noticed a shift in my app usage, particularly towards productivity apps like LinkedIn and
                    Outlook, reflecting my job search activities. Despite the detox, I maintained regular usage of
                    WhatsApp,
                    my primary mode of communication with family in India, but with regulated usage.</p>

                <h3>Refining the Design</h3>
                <figure>

                        during the detox experiment.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In refining my design process, I opted for simplicity and clarity. I used a bubble chart to
                    visualize the correlation between sleep hours and screen time. On further thought, I deciding to
                    omit sleep
                    hours
                    due as they were mostly constant and not affected by any of the factors under consideration. I
                    ditched the bubble chart and continued to explore other ways of visualizing this data.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/polar_area_chart.jpg" class="chart-image" alt="Polar Area Chart">
                    <figcaption>Figure 3: Polar Area Chart showcasing the day-by-day comparison of screen time across
                        different menstrual phases during the detox experiment.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>I tried out visualizing this data using a Stacked Bar Chart, Line Chart, Steamgraph etc to find the
                    best fit for my dataset.
                    For the final design, I chose a polar area chart as it offered a comprehensive day-by-day comparison
                    of
                    screen time, with the area size representing usage intensity. This <strong>unconventional
                        format</strong> facilitated
                    a
                    nuanced understanding of my digital habits across different menstrual phases. By color-coding the
                    phases
                    of the menstrual cycle, I could visually observe variations in my usage patterns. I chose warm
                    colors like red, orange, and yellow to represent menstrual phases. This <strong>departure from
                        traditional
                        color associations</strong> fosters a more inclusive narrative around menstrual health,
                    encouraging open
                    dialogue and understanding. This is useful as
                    I have borderline PMS and it helps me uncover relationships between my menstrual cycle and digital
                    footprint. I also decided to add an option to view the top 3 apps allowed me to
                    regulate
                    my app usage and track my digital activities more efficiently.</p>
                <h3>Design Medium</h3>
                <p>Incorporating chart.js as my design medium, I leveraged its flexibility and functionality to plot and
                    visualize my data effectively. This medium allowed me to explore unconventional representations of
                    my
                    data and challenge traditional visualization practices, aligning with the principles of data
                    feminism
                    and inclusive data analysis.</p>
